## Slide 6: Data Exploration - Feature Relationships
- **Finding**: Strong correlations between claim amounts
- Vehicle claim strongly correlated with total claim amount (0.98)
- Age strongly correlated with months as customer (0.92)

## Slide 7: Feature Selection
- Used Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)
- **Key Finding**: Only 4 features needed for effective prediction:
  1. Vehicle Claim Amount (40.1% importance)
  2. Months as Customer (33.1% importance)
  3. Age (21.2% importance)
  4. Umbrella Limit (5.6% importance)

## Slide 8: Model Performance - ROC Curve
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models evaluated
- Optimal threshold determined through ROC analysis
- AUC = 0.6168

## Slide 9: Model Performance - Metrics Comparison
- **Logistic Regression Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 0.3600
  - Sensitivity: 0.9595 (excellent at catching fraud)
  - Specificity: 0.1637 (many false positives)
  - F1 Score: 0.4251

- **Random Forest Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 0.6567
  - Sensitivity: 0.2568 (misses some fraud)
  - Specificity: 0.7876 (good at confirming legitimate claims)
  - F1 Score: 0.2695

## Slide 10: Visual Summary of Results
- **Model Comparison**:

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Accuracy | 36.00% | 65.67% |
| Sensitivity | 95.95% | 25.68% |
| Specificity | 16.37% | 78.76% |
| Precision | 27.31% | 28.36% |
| F1 Score | 42.51% | 26.95% |

- **Complementary Strengths**: LR catches most fraud, RF confirms legitimate claims

## Slide 11: Performance at Different Thresholds
- Optimal threshold = 0.3 (maximizes F1 score)
- Lower threshold: Higher sensitivity, lower specificity
- Higher threshold: Lower sensitivity, higher specificity

## Slide 12: Key Findings - Question 1
**How can we analyze historical claim data to detect patterns that indicate fraudulent claims?**

- **Feature Selection**: Focus on the 4 most predictive features
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Use resampling techniques
- **Threshold Optimization**: Set appropriate probability threshold (0.3)
- **Model Comparison**: Leverage strengths of different models

## Slide 13: Key Findings - Question 2
**Which features are the most predictive of fraudulent behavior?**

1. **Vehicle Claim Amount** (40.1%): Higher amounts correlate with fraud
2. **Months as Customer** (33.1%): Customer tenure is significant
3. **Age** (21.2%): Customer age provides important signals
4. **Umbrella Limit** (5.6%): Additional liability coverage is informative

## Slide 14: Key Findings - Question 3
**Can we predict the likelihood of fraud for an incoming claim?**

- **Yes**, with complementary model strengths:
  - Logistic Regression: High sensitivity (0.9595)
  - Random Forest: High specificity (0.7876)

## Slide 15: Key Findings - Question 4
**What insights can be drawn from the model that can help in improving the fraud detection process?**

1. Focus on key predictors (vehicle claim amount, customer tenure)
2. Adjust threshold based on business priorities
3. Use complementary models for different stages of detection
4. Manage model complexity to prevent overfitting
5. Allocate investigation resources based on risk scores

## Slide 18: Technical Limitations
- Models trained on limited historical data (1,000 claims)
- Feature selection limited to numerical features
- Some overfitting observed in Random Forest model
- Models may need recalibration as fraud patterns evolve
- Performance depends on data quality and completeness

## Slide 19: Recommendations

   - Logistic Regression for initial screening (high sensitivity)
   - Random Forest for prioritization (higher precision)
2. **Focus Investigation Resources** on high-risk claims
3. **Regularly Retrain Models** to adapt to evolving fraud patterns
4. **Collect Additional Data** related to key predictors
