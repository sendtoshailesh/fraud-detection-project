# Evaluation of Fraud Detection Project Against Criteria

## 1. Data Cleaning Evaluation

### Handling Missing Values ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code correctly identified missing values in columns like 'authorities_contacted' (9.1% missing) and '_c39' (100% missing)
- Question mark ('?') values in categorical columns were properly identified and replaced with NaN values
- Appropriate imputation methods were applied:
  - Numerical columns were filled with median values
  - Categorical columns were filled with mode values
- The approach preserved all 1000 records rather than dropping rows with missing values

### Handling Redundant Values within Categorical Columns ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code included a function `combine_rare_categories()` to identify and combine low-frequency categories
- Categories occurring less than 5% of the time were grouped into an 'Other' category
- This approach reduced sparsity in categorical features and improved model generalization

### Dropping Redundant Columns ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- Columns with high cardinality (>90% unique values) were correctly identified and removed:
  - 'policy_number', 'policy_bind_date', 'policy_annual_premium', 'insured_zip', 'incident_location'
- The completely empty column '_c39' was properly identified and dropped
- The code also removed columns from which useful features had already been extracted

### Correcting Data Types ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- Date columns were properly converted to datetime format:
  - 'incident_date' was converted to datetime
- Categorical columns were converted to the appropriate 'category' data type for efficiency
- Boolean columns ('property_damage', 'police_report_available') were correctly converted from YES/NO to True/False
- Numeric columns were ensured to be in the proper format

### Additional Strengths
- The code included validation of data quality beyond basic cleaning:
  - Checking for negative values in columns that should be positive
  - Validating age ranges for reasonableness
  - Ensuring date consistency (incident date after policy bind date)
  - Detecting and handling outliers in claim amounts
  - Verifying logical relationships between related columns

Overall, the data cleaning process in this project **Meets Expectations** across all criteria. The approach was thorough, preserved data integrity, and properly prepared the dataset for subsequent analysis and modeling.

## 2. Train-Validation Split Evaluation

### Definition of Feature and Target Variables ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- Feature variables (X) were correctly defined by dropping the target column from the cleaned dataset:
  ```python
  X = df_cleaned.drop(columns=['fraud_reported'])
  ```
- Target variable (y) was properly defined as the 'fraud_reported' column:
  ```python
  y = df_cleaned['fraud_reported']
  ```
- The code included verification of the target variable distribution:
  ```python
  print("\nTarget variable distribution:")
  print(df_cleaned['fraud_reported'].value_counts())
  print(df_cleaned['fraud_reported'].value_counts(normalize=True).round(4) * 100, "%")
  ```
- The shapes of the feature matrix and target vector were confirmed:
  ```python
  print(f"\nFeature matrix shape: {X.shape}")
  print(f"Target vector shape: {y.shape}")
  ```

### Data Splitting Implementation ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The data was correctly split into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function:
  ```python
  X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y)
  ```
- The split maintained the required 70:30 ratio as specified by `test_size=0.3`
- Stratification was properly implemented using `stratify=y` to ensure the class distribution was maintained in both sets
- Indices were reset for all resulting datasets:
  ```python
  X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)
  X_val = X_val.reset_index(drop=True)
  y_train = y_train.reset_index(drop=True)
  y_val = y_val.reset_index(drop=True)
  ```
- The code verified the shapes of the resulting training and validation sets:
  ```python
  print(f"Training set shape: X_train {X_train.shape}, y_train {y_train.shape}")
  print(f"Validation set shape: X_val {X_val.shape}, y_val {y_val.shape}")
  ```
- Class distribution was checked in both training and validation sets to ensure proper stratification:
  ```python
  print("\nClass distribution in training set:")
  print(y_train.value_counts())
  print(y_train.value_counts(normalize=True).round(4) * 100, "%")
  
  print("\nClass distribution in validation set:")
  print(y_val.value_counts())
  print(y_val.value_counts(normalize=True).round(4) * 100, "%")
  ```

### Verification of Split Results
- The output confirmed that the training set contained 700 samples (70%) and the validation set contained 300 samples (30%)
- The class distribution was maintained in both sets:
  - Training set: 75.29% non-fraudulent, 24.71% fraudulent
  - Validation set: 75.33% non-fraudulent, 24.67% fraudulent

Overall, the Train-Validation Split implementation in this project **Meets Expectations** across all criteria. The feature and target variables were correctly defined, and the data was properly split into training and validation sets with the required 70:30 ratio while maintaining the class distribution through stratification.
## 3. EDA on Training Data Evaluation

### Univariate Analysis of Numerical Columns ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code correctly identified numerical columns in the training data:
  ```python
  numerical_cols = X_train.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()
  ```
- Distribution plots were created for all numerical columns:
  ```python
  plt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))
  for i, column in enumerate(numerical_cols, 1):  
      plt.subplot(5, 3, i)
      sns.histplot(X_train[column], kde=True)
      plt.title(f'Distribution of {column}')
      plt.tight_layout()
  ```
- The plots were saved for reference:
  ```python
  plt.savefig('numerical_distributions.png')
  ```
- The visualizations provided insights into the distributions of key features like claim amounts, age, and policy details

### Correlation Analysis ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- A correlation matrix was properly created for numerical columns:
  ```python
  correlation_matrix = X_train[numerical_cols].corr()
  ```
- The correlation matrix was visualized as a heatmap:
  ```python
  plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))
  sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=0.5)
  ```
- Highly correlated features were identified and analyzed:
  ```python
  print("\nHighly correlated features (|correlation| > 0.7):")
  corr_pairs = []
  for i in range(len(correlation_matrix.columns)):
      for j in range(i):
          if abs(correlation_matrix.iloc[i, j]) > 0.7:
              corr_pairs.append((correlation_matrix.columns[i], correlation_matrix.columns[j], correlation_matrix.iloc[i, j]))
  ```
- The analysis revealed important correlations, such as:
  - age and months_as_customer: 0.92
  - vehicle_claim and total_claim_amount: 0.98
  - injury_claim and total_claim_amount: 0.82
  - property_claim and total_claim_amount: 0.82

### Class Distribution Visualization ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The class distribution of the target variable was properly visualized:
  ```python
  plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
  sns.countplot(x=y_train)
  plt.title('Class Distribution in Training Data')
  plt.xlabel('Fraud Reported (Y/N)')
  plt.ylabel('Count')
  ```
- The visualization clearly showed the class imbalance in the training data
- The plot was saved for reference:
  ```python
  plt.savefig('class_balance.png')
  ```

### Bivariate Analysis ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- A function was created to analyze the relationship between categorical features and the target variable:
  ```python
  def target_likelihood_analysis(df, feature, target='fraud_reported'):
      # Create a crosstab of the feature and target
      crosstab = pd.crosstab(df[feature], df[target], normalize='index')
      # If 'Y' is in the columns, select it, otherwise select the first column
      if 'Y' in crosstab.columns:
          likelihood = crosstab['Y']
      else:
          likelihood = crosstab.iloc[:, 0]
      # Sort by likelihood
      likelihood = likelihood.sort_values(ascending=False)
      return likelihood
  ```
- The function was applied to categorical columns and results were visualized:
  ```python
  for column in categorical_cols[:5]:
      print(f"\nTarget likelihood for {column}:")
      likelihood = target_likelihood_analysis(pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis=1), column)
      print(likelihood)
      
      # Plot the likelihood
      plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
      likelihood.plot(kind='bar')
      plt.title(f'Fraud Likelihood by {column}')
      plt.xlabel(column)
      plt.ylabel('Fraud Likelihood')
      plt.tight_layout()
      plt.savefig(f'likelihood_{column}.png')
  ```
- The relationship between numerical features and the target variable was also explored:
  ```python
  for column in numerical_cols[:5]:
      plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
      sns.boxplot(x='fraud_reported', y=column, data=train_data)
      plt.title(f'{column} by Fraud Reported')
      plt.tight_layout()
      plt.savefig(f'boxplot_{column}.png')
  ```
- Mean values for numerical features by target were calculated and analyzed:
  ```python
  mean_by_target = train_data.groupby('fraud_reported')[numerical_cols].mean()
  ```

### Additional Strengths
- The EDA was comprehensive, covering all required aspects
- Visualizations were properly formatted with titles, labels, and appropriate sizing
- The analysis included both graphical and statistical components
- Insights were derived from the visualizations, such as identifying correlations and patterns related to fraud

Overall, the EDA on Training Data in this project **Meets Expectations** across all criteria. The analysis was thorough, well-visualized, and provided meaningful insights into the data patterns and relationships that could inform the subsequent modeling steps.
## 4. Feature Engineering Evaluation

### Resampling to Handle Class Imbalance ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code properly identified the class imbalance in the training data (75.3% non-fraudulent vs. 24.7% fraudulent)
- RandomOverSampler was correctly implemented to balance the classes:
  ```python
  ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)
  X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
  ```
- The resampling was verified to achieve a balanced distribution:
  ```python
  print("\nClass distribution after resampling:")
  print(pd.Series(y_train_resampled).value_counts())
  # Output showed 527 samples for each class (50% each)
  ```

### Creation of New Features ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code attempted to create new features from date columns, though these were dropped earlier in data cleaning
- The code properly handled potential errors in feature creation using try-except blocks:
  ```python
  try:
      if 'policy_annual_premium' in X_train_resampled.columns and 'months_as_customer' in X_train_resampled.columns:
          X_train_resampled['total_premiums_per_month'] = X_train_resampled['policy_annual_premium'] / X_train_resampled['months_as_customer']
          X_val['total_premiums_per_month'] = X_val['policy_annual_premium'] / X_val['months_as_customer']
  ```
- The code also attempted to create a 'claim_per_vehicle' feature:
  ```python
  try:
      if 'total_claim_amount' in X_train_resampled.columns and 'number_of_vehicles_involved' in X_train_resampled.columns:
          X_train_resampled['claim_per_vehicle'] = X_train_resampled['total_claim_amount'] / X_train_resampled['number_of_vehicles_involved']
  ```
- Infinity values from division operations were properly handled:
  ```python
  X_train_resampled.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)
  X_val.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)
  ```

### Handling Redundant Columns ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code identified and dropped redundant columns:
  ```python
  columns_to_drop = [
      'policy_bind_date',  # Already extracted useful information
      'incident_date',     # Already extracted useful information
      'policy_number'      # Unique identifier with no predictive power
  ]
  ```
- The columns were properly dropped from both training and validation sets:
  ```python
  X_train_resampled = X_train_resampled.drop(columns=[col for col in columns_to_drop if col in X_train_resampled.columns])
  X_val = X_val.drop(columns=[col for col in columns_to_drop if col in X_val.columns])
  ```
- The code verified the shapes after dropping columns:
  ```python
  print(f"Training set shape after dropping columns: {X_train_resampled.shape}")
  print(f"Validation set shape after dropping columns: {X_val.shape}")
  ```

### Combining Low-Frequency Values in Categorical Columns ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- A function was created to identify and combine low-frequency categories:
  ```python
  def combine_rare_categories(df, column, threshold=0.05):
      # Calculate the frequency of each category
      value_counts = df[column].value_counts(normalize=True)
      # Identify rare categories (below threshold)
      rare_categories = value_counts[value_counts < threshold].index.tolist()
      if rare_categories:
          # Replace rare categories with 'Other'
          df[column] = df[column].apply(lambda x: 'Other' if x in rare_categories else x)
          print(f"Combined rare categories in {column}: {rare_categories}")
      return df
  ```
- The function was applied to all categorical columns in both training and validation sets:
  ```python
  categorical_cols = X_train_resampled.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist()
  for column in categorical_cols:
      X_train_resampled = combine_rare_categories(X_train_resampled, column)
      X_val = combine_rare_categories(X_val, column)
  ```
- Categories occurring in less than 5% of the data were combined into an 'Other' category

### Creating Dummy Variables ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- Categorical columns were correctly identified for dummy variable creation:
  ```python
  categorical_cols = X_train_resampled.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist()
  ```
- Dummy variables were created for both training and validation data:
  ```python
  X_train_dummies = pd.get_dummies(X_train_resampled, columns=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)
  X_val_dummies = pd.get_dummies(X_val, columns=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)
  ```
- The code ensured that training and validation data had the same columns:
  ```python
  for col in X_train_dummies.columns:
      if col not in X_val_dummies.columns:
          X_val_dummies[col] = 0
  for col in X_val_dummies.columns:
      if col not in X_train_dummies.columns:
          X_train_dummies[col] = 0
  ```
- The dependent feature was also properly converted to dummy variables for both sets:
  ```python
  y_train_dummies = y_train_resampled.map({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})
  y_val_dummies = y_val.map({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})
  ```
- The conversion was verified:
  ```python
  print("Training target variable conversion:")
  print(f"- Original values: {y_train_resampled.unique()}")
  print(f"- Converted values: {y_train_dummies.unique()}")
  ```

### Feature Scaling ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- Numerical columns were correctly identified for scaling:
  ```python
  numerical_cols = X_train_dummies.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()
  ```
- StandardScaler was properly initialized and applied:
  ```python
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  X_train_dummies[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(X_train_dummies[numerical_cols])
  ```
- The same scaler was used for validation data to ensure consistent scaling:
  ```python
  X_val_dummies[numerical_cols] = scaler.transform(X_val_dummies[numerical_cols])
  ```
- The scaling was verified by displaying samples of the scaled data:
  ```python
  print("\nFirst 5 rows of scaled training data:")
  print(X_train_dummies[numerical_cols].head())
  print("\nFirst 5 rows of scaled validation data:")
  print(X_val_dummies[numerical_cols].head())
  ```

### Additional Strengths
- The feature engineering process was comprehensive and methodical
- Proper error handling was implemented for feature creation
- The code ensured consistency between training and validation datasets
- NaN values were handled appropriately for both numerical and categorical columns

Overall, the Feature Engineering in this project **Meets Expectations** across all criteria. The implementation was thorough, well-structured, and followed best practices for preparing data for machine learning models.
## 5. Model Building Evaluation

### Feature Selection using RFECV ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- RFECV was properly implemented to select the most important features:
  ```python
  rfecv = RFECV(estimator=logreg, step=1, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1)
  rfecv = rfecv.fit(X_train_numeric, y_train_dummies)
  ```
- The code correctly identified the optimal number of features:
  ```python
  print(f"Optimal number of features: {rfecv.n_features_}")
  # Output showed 4 features were selected
  ```
- The selected features were properly extracted and stored:
  ```python
  selected_numeric_features = np.array(numeric_cols)[rfecv.support_].tolist()
  print(f"Selected {len(selected_numeric_features)} numeric features")
  # Selected features: ['age', 'months_as_customer', 'umbrella_limit', 'vehicle_claim']
  ```
- Feature rankings were analyzed and displayed:
  ```python
  feature_ranking = pd.DataFrame({
      'Feature': numeric_cols,
      'Ranking': rfecv.ranking_,
      'Selected': rfecv.support_
  })
  feature_ranking = feature_ranking.sort_values('Ranking')
  ```

### Logistic Regression Model Building ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- A logistic regression model was built using the selected features:
  ```python
  X_train_model = X_train_dummies[col]
  X_train_sm = sm.add_constant(X_train_model)
  logit_model = sm.Logit(y_train_dummies, X_train_sm)
  result = logit_model.fit(disp=0)
  ```
- Multicollinearity was evaluated using VIF:
  ```python
  vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
  vif_data["Feature"] = X_train_sm.columns
  vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X_train_sm.values, i) for i in range(X_train_sm.shape[1])]
  ```
- The model summary was analyzed, including p-values:
  ```python
  print("\nLogistic Regression Model Summary:")
  print(result.summary2())
  ```
- Predictions were made and model performance was assessed:
  ```python
  train_pred_proba = result.predict(X_train_sm)
  train_results = pd.DataFrame({
      'Actual': y_train_dummies,
      'Predicted_Proba': train_pred_proba
  })
  train_results['Predicted_Class'] = (train_results['Predicted_Proba'] >= 0.5).astype(int)
  ```
- Performance metrics were calculated:
  ```python
  accuracy = (train_results['Actual'] == train_results['Predicted_Class']).mean()
  conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(train_results['Actual'], train_results['Predicted_Class'])
  tn, fp, fn, tp = conf_matrix.ravel()
  sensitivity = tp / (tp + fn)
  specificity = tn / (tn + fp)
  precision = tp / (tp + fp)
  f1 = 2 * (precision * sensitivity) / (precision + sensitivity)
  ```

### Finding Optimal Cutoff ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The ROC curve was plotted to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate:
  ```python
  fpr, tpr, thresholds, roc_auc = plot_roc_curve(train_results['Actual'], train_results['Predicted_Proba'])
  ```
- Various probability cutoffs were evaluated:
  ```python
  cutoffs = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
  for cutoff in cutoffs:
      train_results[f'Predicted_Class_{cutoff}'] = (train_results['Predicted_Proba'] >= cutoff).astype(int)
  ```
- Performance metrics were calculated for each cutoff:
  ```python
  metrics_list = []
  for cutoff in cutoffs:
      pred_col = f'Predicted_Class_{cutoff}'
      cm = confusion_matrix(train_results['Actual'], train_results[pred_col])
      tn, fp, fn, tp = cm.ravel()
      
      accuracy = (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)
      sensitivity = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
      specificity = tn / (tn + fp) if (tn + fp) > 0 else 0
      precision = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
      f1 = 2 * (precision * sensitivity) / (precision + sensitivity) if (precision + sensitivity) > 0 else 0
  ```
- The metrics were visualized to identify the optimal cutoff:
  ```python
  plt.plot(cutoff_metrics['Cutoff'], cutoff_metrics['Accuracy'], marker='o', label='Accuracy')
  plt.plot(cutoff_metrics['Cutoff'], cutoff_metrics['Sensitivity'], marker='o', label='Sensitivity')
  plt.plot(cutoff_metrics['Cutoff'], cutoff_metrics['Specificity'], marker='o', label='Specificity')
  plt.plot(cutoff_metrics['Cutoff'], cutoff_metrics['F1'], marker='o', label='F1 Score')
  ```
- The optimal cutoff was determined based on F1 score:
  ```python
  optimal_cutoff = cutoff_metrics.loc[cutoff_metrics['F1'].idxmax(), 'Cutoff']
  # Optimal cutoff was found to be 0.3
  ```
- A precision-recall curve was also plotted:
  ```python
  precision_curve, recall_curve, _ = precision_recall_curve(train_results['Actual'], train_results['Predicted_Proba'])
  pr_auc = auc(recall_curve, precision_curve)
  ```

### Random Forest Model Building ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- A random forest model was built using the selected features:
  ```python
  rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
  rf.fit(X_train_selected, y_train_dummies)
  ```
- Feature importances were analyzed:
  ```python
  feature_importances = rf.feature_importances_
  importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
      'Feature': X_train_selected.columns,
      'Importance': feature_importances
  })
  importance_df = importance_df.sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)
  ```
- Predictions were made and model performance was assessed:
  ```python
  y_train_pred_rf = rf_important.predict(X_train_important)
  accuracy_rf = (y_train_dummies == y_train_pred_rf).mean()
  conf_matrix_rf = confusion_matrix(y_train_dummies, y_train_pred_rf)
  ```
- Performance metrics were calculated:
  ```python
  tn_rf, fp_rf, fn_rf, tp_rf = conf_matrix_rf.ravel()
  sensitivity_rf = tp_rf / (tp_rf + fn_rf)
  specificity_rf = tn_rf / (tn_rf + fp_rf)
  precision_rf = tp_rf / (tp_rf + fp_rf)
  f1_rf = 2 * (precision_rf * sensitivity_rf) / (precision_rf + sensitivity_rf)
  ```
- Cross-validation was performed to check for overfitting:
  ```python
  cv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_important, X_train_important, y_train_dummies, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
  ```

### Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- Grid search was used for hyperparameter tuning:
  ```python
  param_grid = {
      'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
      'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
      'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
      'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
  }
  grid_search = GridSearchCV(
      estimator=RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
      param_grid=param_grid,
      cv=5,
      scoring='accuracy',
      n_jobs=-1
  )
  ```
- The grid search was fitted to find optimal parameters:
  ```python
  grid_search.fit(X_train_important, y_train_dummies)
  ```
- The best parameters were identified:
  ```python
  best_params = grid_search.best_params_
  # Best parameters: {'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}
  ```
- A tuned model was built using the optimal parameters:
  ```python
  rf_tuned = RandomForestClassifier(
      n_estimators=best_params['n_estimators'],
      max_depth=best_params['max_depth'],
      min_samples_split=best_params['min_samples_split'],
      min_samples_leaf=best_params['min_samples_leaf'],
      random_state=42
  )
  rf_tuned.fit(X_train_important, y_train_dummies)
  ```
- Performance of the tuned model was evaluated:
  ```python
  y_train_pred_rf_tuned = rf_tuned.predict(X_train_important)
  accuracy_rf_tuned = (y_train_dummies == y_train_pred_rf_tuned).mean()
  conf_matrix_rf_tuned = confusion_matrix(y_train_dummies, y_train_pred_rf_tuned)
  ```
- Comprehensive performance metrics were calculated:
  ```python
  tn_rf_tuned, fp_rf_tuned, fn_rf_tuned, tp_rf_tuned = conf_matrix_rf_tuned.ravel()
  sensitivity_rf_tuned = tp_rf_tuned / (tp_rf_tuned + fn_rf_tuned)
  specificity_rf_tuned = tn_rf_tuned / (tn_rf_tuned + fp_rf_tuned)
  precision_rf_tuned = tp_rf_tuned / (tp_rf_tuned + fp_rf_tuned)
  f1_rf_tuned = 2 * (precision_rf_tuned * sensitivity_rf_tuned) / (precision_rf_tuned + sensitivity_rf_tuned)
  ```

### Additional Strengths

- Multiple evaluation metrics were used to assess model performance
- The code included visualization of key performance curves
- Cross-validation was used to check for overfitting
- The analysis included interpretation of model results

Overall, the Model Building in this project **Meets Expectations** across all criteria. The implementation was thorough, well-structured, and followed best practices for building and evaluating machine learning models.
## 6. Prediction and Model Evaluation

### Predictions on Validation Data using Logistic Regression ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- The code correctly selected the relevant features for the validation data:
  ```python
  X_val_model = X_val_dummies[col]
  print(f"Selected {X_val_model.shape[1]} features for validation data")
  print(f"First few selected features: {col[:5]}")
  ```
- A constant term was properly added for the statsmodels implementation:
  ```python
  X_val_sm = sm.add_constant(X_val_model)
  print(f"Validation data shape after adding constant: {X_val_sm.shape}")
  ```
- Predictions were made on the validation data using the trained logistic regression model:
  ```python
  y_validation_pred = result.predict(X_val_sm)
  print(f"Shape of predicted probabilities: {y_validation_pred.shape}")
  ```
- The predictions were stored in a DataFrame with the actual values:
  ```python
  val_results = pd.DataFrame({
      'Actual': y_val_dummies,
      'Predicted_Proba': y_validation_pred
  })
  ```
- The optimal cutoff determined from the training data was applied to make final predictions:

  ```
- Predictions were made on the validation data using the tuned random forest model:
  ```python
  val_pred_rf = rf_tuned.predict(X_val_rf)
  print(f"Shape of predictions: {val_pred_rf.shape}")
  print(f"First 5 predictions: {val_pred_rf[:5]}")
  ```

### Performance Evaluation of Both Models ✅ (Meets Expectations)
- For the logistic regression model, comprehensive evaluation metrics were calculated:
  ```python
  val_accuracy = (val_results['Actual'] == val_results['Final_Predicted_Class']).mean()
  val_conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(val_results['Actual'], val_results['Final_Predicted_Class'])
  val_tn, val_fp, val_fn, val_tp = val_conf_matrix.ravel()
  val_sensitivity = val_tp / (val_tp + val_fn)
  val_specificity = val_tn / (val_tn + val_fp)
  val_precision = val_tp / (val_tp + val_fp)
  val_f1 = 2 * (val_precision * val_sensitivity) / (val_precision + val_sensitivity)
  ```
  - The results showed:
    - Accuracy: 0.3600
    - Sensitivity: 0.9595
    - Specificity: 0.1637
    - Precision: 0.2731
    - F1 Score: 0.4251

- For the random forest model, the same comprehensive evaluation metrics were calculated:
  ```python
  val_accuracy_rf = (y_val_dummies == val_pred_rf).mean()
  val_conf_matrix_rf = confusion_matrix(y_val_dummies, val_pred_rf)
  val_tn_rf, val_fp_rf, val_fn_rf, val_tp_rf = val_conf_matrix_rf.ravel()
  val_sensitivity_rf = val_tp_rf / (val_tp_rf + val_fn_rf)
  val_specificity_rf = val_tn_rf / (val_tn_rf + val_fp_rf)
  val_precision_rf = val_tp_rf / (val_tp_rf + val_fp_rf)
  val_f1_rf = 2 * (val_precision_rf * val_sensitivity_rf) / (val_precision_rf + val_sensitivity_rf)
  ```
  - The results showed:
    - Accuracy: 0.6567
    - Sensitivity: 0.2568
    - Specificity: 0.7876
    - Precision: 0.2836
    - F1 Score: 0.2695

- Classification reports were generated for both models:
  ```python
  print("\nValidation Classification Report:")
  print(classification_report(val_results['Actual'], val_results['Final_Predicted_Class']))
  
  print("\nValidation Classification Report:")
  print(classification_report(y_val_dummies, val_pred_rf))
  ```

- The evaluation provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model:
  - The logistic regression model had high sensitivity (0.9595) but low specificity (0.1637)
  - The random forest model had higher specificity (0.7876) and overall accuracy (0.6567) but lower sensitivity (0.2568)

      crosstab = pd.crosstab(df[feature], df[target], normalize='index')
      # If 'Y' is in the columns, select it, otherwise select the first column
      if 'Y' in crosstab.columns:
          likelihood = crosstab['Y']
      else:
          likelihood = crosstab.iloc[:, 0]
      # Sort by likelihood
      likelihood = likelihood.sort_values(ascending=False)
      return likelihood
  ```
  ```python
  # Function to combine low-frequency categories
  def combine_rare_categories(df, column, threshold=0.05):
      # Calculate the frequency of each category
      value_counts = df[column].value_counts(normalize=True)
      # Identify rare categories (below threshold)
      rare_categories = value_counts[value_counts < threshold].index.tolist()
      if rare_categories:
          # Replace rare categories with 'Other'
          df[column] = df[column].apply(lambda x: 'Other' if x in rare_categories else x)
          print(f"Combined rare categories in {column}: {rare_categories}")
      return df
  ```
  ```python
  # Function for ROC curve plotting
  def plot_roc_curve(y_true, y_score):
      # Calculate ROC curve
      fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_score)
      roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)
      # Plot ROC curve
      plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
      plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (area = {roc_auc:.2f})')
      plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
      plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
      plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
      plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
