# fraud-detection-project
build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate based on historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features such as claim amounts, customer profiles, claim types and approval times, the company aims to predict the claims that are likely to be fraudulent before they are approved



Developing a predictive model for insurance fraud detection offers significant business value. Fraud investigations currently rely on manual processes such as reviewing claims, calling claimants and conducting background checks, which are time-consuming and inefficient. These delays allow fraud to go undetected whereas legitimate claims face unnecessary scrutiny. Predictive modelling enables early identification of high-risk claims, streamlining fraud investigations, reducing financial losses and improving operational efficiency. It also enhances customer experience by expediting legitimate claims. Ultimately, an effective fraud detection model leads to better decision-making, optimised resource allocation and increased profitability.


**Goal**

* Global Insure aims to enhance its ability to detect fraudulent insurance claims by leveraging historical claim data.   
* The company seeks to identify patterns and key indicators that differentiate fraudulent claims from genuine ones.   
* By developing a predictive model, it intends to assess the likelihood of fraud in incoming claims, enabling proactive fraud detection and reducing financial losses. 

   
To summarise, find the answer to the following questions:

* How can we analyse historical claim data to detect patterns that indicate fraudulent claims?  
* Which features are the most predictive of fraudulent behaviour?  
* Based on past data, can we predict the likelihood of fraud for an incoming claim?   
* What insights can be drawn from the model that can help in improving the fraud detection process?

   
Overall, the objective is to build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate based on historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features such as claim amounts, customer profiles, claim types and approval times, the company aims to predict the claims that are likely to be fraudulent before they are approved.

# Fraudulent Claim Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for detecting fraudulent insurance claims for Global Insure. By analyzing historical claim data, we identify patterns and key indicators that differentiate fraudulent claims from genuine ones, enabling proactive fraud detection and reducing financial losses.

## Business Objective
Global Insure wants to enhance its ability to detect fraudulent insurance claims by leveraging historical claim data. The company seeks to identify patterns and key indicators that differentiate fraudulent claims from genuine ones. By developing a predictive model, it intends to assess the likelihood of fraud in incoming claims, enabling proactive fraud detection and reducing financial losses.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about insurance claims, including:
- Customer details (age, occupation, hobbies)
- Policy information (coverage limits, premiums)
- Incident specifics (type, severity, location)
- Claim details (amounts, types of damage)
- Vehicle information (make, model, year)
- Fraud indicator (whether the claim was reported as fraud)

## Project Structure
The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and initial exploration of the dataset
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values through imputation, removing redundant features, and fixing data types
3. **Train-Validation Split**: Dividing data into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing patterns and relationships in the training data
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, handling class imbalance, and preparing data for modeling
6. **Model Building**: Developing and optimizing Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
7. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Testing models on validation data and comparing performance

## Key Findings
1. The most important predictors of fraud include incident severity, claim amounts, and policy details
2. Class imbalance was addressed using random oversampling, which improved model performance
3. The optimal probability threshold for fraud detection was determined through ROC and precision-recall analysis
4. Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models performed well, with Random Forest showing slightly better performance
5. The models can effectively flag potentially fraudulent claims for further investigation

## Recommendations
1. Implement the model in the claims processing workflow to flag suspicious claims for review
2. Focus investigation resources on claims with high fraud probability scores
3. Regularly retrain the model with new data to maintain its effectiveness
4. Consider collecting additional data points that might improve fraud detection
5. Develop a user-friendly interface for claims adjusters to interpret model predictions

## Files
- `Fraudulent_Claim_Detection_Solution.py`: Main Python script with the complete solution
- `insurance_claims.csv`: Dataset containing insurance claim information
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, imbalanced-learn

## How to Run
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Place the `insurance_claims.csv` file in the same directory as the script
3. Run the script: `python Fraudulent_Claim_Detection_Solution.py`
4. Review the output for model performance and insights

## Conclusion
The developed models provide Global Insure with an effective tool for early fraud detection, potentially saving significant amounts in fraudulent payouts while streamlining the claims process for legitimate customers.
